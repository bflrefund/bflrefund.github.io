<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>
<p>A lot of Bitcoin ASIC mining equipment is has been sold by BFL and remains undelivered.</p>
<p>BFL are not honoring refunds and delivery of their products. They have failed to meet any of their deadlines, leading to the joke of "two weeks(tm)".</p>

<p>BFL refuse to give any refunds for undelivered goods which is against US and UK laws. You have a right to cancel your order at any time before delivery, and usually for a period after delivery too.</p>

<p>People who paid via credit card or Paypal (using any funding source) are however in luck. If you paid by Paypal you can get a refund now usually within the same day. If you paid by credit card direct, you should contact your card company and site non-delivery.</p>

<a name="how-to-get-a-refund-by-paypal" class="anchor" href="#how-to-get-a-refund-by-paypal"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to get a refund by Paypal</h3>

<p>Paypal does not allow "pre-order" funding and Paypal's TOS state a product must be shipped within 20 days of purchase. All BFL orders have been "pre-orders" so far. This means anything ordered under these terms is illegal under Paypal's terms of service and they can give a refund at any point.</p>

<p>You can normally dispute a Paypal transaction for non-delivery up to and including 45 days from the purchase date. A dispute will be automatically closed.</p>

<p>If you ordered within the 45 day period and open a dispute, it should close in your favor because BFL cannot provide proof of delivery since they have not delivered the goods. For 99% of people wanting a refund, their orders are over the 45 day period anyway.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-process" class="anchor" href="#the-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The process</h3>

<p>BF Labs Inc are known to Paypal and they have frozen their account permanently. There are now dedicated case-workers who will help you <strong>outside of the normal dispute resolution process</strong>. This is only because they have received so many complaints already and it is clear BF Labs Inc have clearly broken Paypal's rules by raising money for products they cannot deliver in 20 days from purchase date.</p>

<p>You can contact a caseworker with the specifics of your case and at the time of writing, people are receiving refunds within 12 hours of submitting their complaint (on weekdays).</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-to-include" class="anchor" href="#what-to-include"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to include</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your paypal email address</li>
<li>Your contact phone numbers (day and evening)</li>
<li>The date(s) of the orders</li>
<li>The transaction IDs and of each and every payment you are disputing to BF Labs Inc.</li>
</ul><p>If you already filed a dispute with Paypal that was closed due to the 45 day limits, include the Paypal dispute IDs also.</p>

<p>You must then state that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the goods were sold on a pre-order basis for delivery in around 2 months</li>
<li>you have not yet received delivery of the goods you ordered and it's been months</li>
<li>they have continuously failed to meet delivery deadlines</li>
<li>they have refused you a refund</li>
</ul><p>Ask for your refund.</p>

<h3>
<a name="who-to-contact" class="anchor" href="#who-to-contact"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who to contact</h3>
