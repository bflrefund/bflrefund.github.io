<a name="summary" class="anchor" href="#summary"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h3>
<p>A lot of Bitcoin ASIC mining equipment is has been sold by BFL and remains undelivered.</p>
<p>BFL are not honoring refunds and delivery of their products. They have failed to meet any of their 
deadlines, leading to the joke of "two weeks(tm)".</p>

<p>BFL refuse to give any refunds for undelivered goods which is against US and UK laws. You have a 
right to cancel your order at any time before delivery, and usually for a period after delivery too.</p>

<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to get a refund by Paypal</h3>

<p>Paypal does not allow "pre-order" funding and Paypal's TOS state a product must be shipped within 20 
days of purchase. All BFL orders have been "pre-orders" so far. This means anything ordered under these 
terms is illegal under Paypal's terms of service and they can give a refund at any point.</p>

<p>BF Labs Inc are known to Paypal and they have frozen their account permanently so they cannot sell any more
by Paypal. There are now dedicated case-workers who will help you <strong>outside of the normal 
dispute resolution process</strong>. This is only because they have received so many 
complaints already and it is clear BF Labs Inc have clearly broken Paypal's rules by 
raising money for products they cannot deliver in 20 days from purchase date.</p>

<h3>
<a name="the-process" class="anchor" href="#the-process"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>
The process</h3>

<p><strong>BEFORE YOU BEGIN</strong> make sure you have opened a dispute
by inside your Paypal account FOR EACH TRANSACTION SEPARATELY and say you want a refund because the goods
have not been delivered. It will be auto-closed withing a minute if your purchase was over 45 days ago. 
Make a note of the PP dispute IDs for later along with the individual paypal transaction IDs.
</p>

<p>Contact a caseworker directly by email with the specifics of your case.</p>

<h3>
<a name="what-to-include" class="anchor" href="#what-to-include"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What to include</h3>

<ul>
<li>Your name</li>
<li>Your paypal email address</li>
<li>Your contact phone numbers (day and evening)</li>
<li>The date(s) of the orders</li>
<li>The transaction IDs and of each and every payment you are disputing to BF Labs Inc.</li>
<li>The paypal dispute IDs.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must then state that:</p>

<ul>
<li>the goods were sold on a pre-order basis for delivery in around 2 months</li>
<li>you have not yet received delivery of the goods you ordered and it's been months</li>
<li>they have continuously failed to meet delivery deadlines</li>
<li>they have refused you a refund</li>
</ul><p>Ask for your refund.</p>

Here is a sample letter which has gotten results. You may copy it for your use:

Subject: Complaint about BF Labs Inc. fraud

I have a complaint to file against a Paypal merchant, 
BF Labs Inc, (office@butterflylabs.com)

This company is now infamous on the internet for defrauding customers. I have been 
defrauded of $xxxxxx. They have been selling physical goods on a pre-order basis 
(for delivery later than 20 days) against Paypals terms of service.

I bought physical goods several months ago and they still have not been delivered.

They have constantly delayed delivery which I believe is designed to cause the expiry 
of Paypal's 45 day limit on disputes.

Unfortunately, I believed their lies and gave them the benefit of the doubt until 
recently when I then came to know one of the company's founders is a convicted felon 
who is still on probation for running a previous "long con" operation.

I request a refund from BF Labs Inc I was refused saying "all orders are final" even 
though I have still not received delivery of my orders.

Here are the transaction ID

[paypal transaction ID list]

I filed claims in the paypal dispute center but they were automatically 
closed because it's outside the 45 day period.

[paypal dispute reference list]

I would be very grateful if you could escalate this issue and refund my 
money because BF Labs Inc. have broken Paypal terms of service by 
selling pre-orders and not delivering within 20 days. I have been a loyal customer 
and hope Paypal can protect us all from fraudsters like this.

Yours sincerely,

[your name] 
Tel [your phone numbers]
